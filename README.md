# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets_NB
This repository contains the code for a sentiment analysis of tweets from twitter_samples DataSet available in the nltk library using word frequencies and Naive Bayes algorithm.
</br></br>
There are two codes: </br>
1. First one uses the already implemented "MultinomialNB" feature of the sklearn's library.
2. The second one uses Naive Bayes algorithm implemented from scratch </br></br>
Data preprocessing (removing stopwords, punctuations and applying stemming to the words) was done using various features of the nltk library.</br></br>
The programs take a tweet as an input and predicts whether it depicts a positive sentiment or negative sentiment.</br>
Both implementations of the sentiment analysis of tweets give an accuracy of about 99.4%.
